# MCP-Group2: Noisy Surfaces

By Leon MÃ¼ller and Markus Horlemann.

Noisy Surfaces is a Fusion360 Add-In that allows users to add randomly generated noise to their bodies and surfaces for a more natural, rough look and feel. An installation guide and description of the plugin and its functionalities can be downloaded here: [manual.pdf](uploads/06feca29a99587cb9de21b6ca97dad22/manual.pdf)

When creating and modelling 3D objects, it is important to have a variety of easy-to-use editing tools that allow for extensive modifications. The Noisy Surfaces plugin for Fusion360 offers just that: Numerous options for customizing surface noises and distorting any object in Fusion. By simply using an existing mesh or converting an object to a mesh, it is possibly to apply the plugin. Then it is possible to choose between five different filters, to create a turbulent, patterned-like, self-customised, or uneven surface. The result is a customised, optionally highly detailed, more natural looking 3D model, within a few clicks.
